# Naive-bayes-Classifier

Naive Bayes classifiers constitute a family of classification algorithms grounded in Bayes' Theorem, encompassing a range of techniques rather than a singular algorithm. These algorithms share a fundamental principle wherein each pair of features used for classification is assumed to be independent of one another. Despite its simplicity, the Naive Bayes classifier stands out as one of the most straightforward yet effective tools for constructing machine learning models with swift prediction capabilities.

The nomenclature "Naive" in Naive Bayes stems from the classifier's simplifying assumption. Specifically, it assumes that, given the class label, the features characterizing an observation are conditionally independent of each other. This assumption significantly simplifies the modeling process and computation, making Naive Bayes particularly adept at handling large datasets and achieving quick predictions. The term "Bayes" in the name pays homage to Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian who formulated Bayes' theorem, the foundational concept behind these classifiers..
